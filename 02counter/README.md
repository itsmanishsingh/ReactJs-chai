## Hooks 
- useState is a hook itself
- Hooks are used to update the value of a particular variable at different places.
Hooks allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components without needing to use class components. They enable functional components to have stateful logic, lifecycle methods, and other React features previously available only in class components.

Before the introduction of hooks, functional components were stateless and could not hold or manage their own state.
