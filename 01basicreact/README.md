- ReactJs is a library
Framework vs Library
- Framework is like a military , one must follow the rules 
- Library is like a cool dude , one has the freedom to perform task , ie less rules.

Process to start a application 
Ways to start a project 

- npx create-react-app .    "Node package executor"
- npm create-react-app .    "Node package manager"
    - The "." means the file name or the projects 
    - If the name is not provided then the command prompt takes the folder name as the default name for the project

For the React project to run 
    - npm run start


Folder Structure
->src
- reportWebVitals-> Helps in tracking of the files or project

Inside the Public folder 
 - We use only index.html file 
 - We donot write code in the particular html


Inside the Src folder
 - All the files are not required
 - index.js
 - App.js

## "react-scripts"
- It helps in injecting the "JS" file in the main "index.html" file
- Check the launched page "view page source"

## <React.StrictMode> </React.StrictMode>
React's Strict mode helps developers identify and fix issues in their code. Strict mode runs in development mode and can be enabled by adding a component at the beginning of the application.


## Norms
- Function name must be in Uppercase
- Even the file name also in Uppercase
